# Learning machine learning models during training

During my practical training at the [National Institute for Research & Development in Informatics](https://www.ici.ro/en/) in Bucharest, I was assigned the task of training several machine learning models, starting with simpler ones and progressing to more customizable approaches. The scripts for each model are provided as Jupyter notebooks for easier experimentation.

## Project Structure
- [Ultralytics YOLOv8](/Ultralytics_YOLOv8/) used to become familiar with the training process.
- [Titanic dataset](/Titanic_dataset/) downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
- [SkLearn](/SkLearn_Titanic/) to experiment with multiple models using the Titanic dataset.
- [PyTorch](/PyTorch_Titanic/) for training on the same dataset with greater control over hyperparameters.
