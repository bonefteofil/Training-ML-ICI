The dataset includes 3451 images.
Arrows-stop-signs are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 224x224 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random exposure adjustment of between -11 and +11 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.5 percent of pixels
